## Explanation

An indie video game studio needs a database to store information related to its business activity. In addition, this database will store information from its website.

-First of all, we will store the users and the type of user they are. We will also have a table where we will store information about the user of the buyer type in case he/she is deleted.

-Within the website it will be possible to buy game serials, so we will need a table where to store the shopping cart and the transactions of the website. In addition, coupons for discounts can be used on the website, which can be of different types.

-Apart from buying them, a user will be able to store his or her favourites for purchase.

-A game has a specific genre, and can be created for several platforms. The price for each platform can be different, and it does not have to be available on one platform or another at the same time.
Also, when a game is sold, a serial is sold for the game on a specific platform.
Each game has a different cover, and we want to save the path where these images are stored. These images will be used on the web, so we need to save the original one and a smaller one to be used on the web.

-In the database we also want to save the information of the employees of the studio, who are also users of the platform.
We want to store their country of birth from a list of countries, the type of experience they have (junior, middle...) and their role in the company (3d artist, programmer...).
We also want to store information about their current and total salary received by the company, and the participation they have done in each videogame.
